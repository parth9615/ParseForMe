  "readme": "# stackback\n\nReturns an array of CallSite objects for a captured stacktrace. Useful if you want to access the frame for an error object.\n\n## use\n\n```javascript\nvar stackback = require('stackback');\n\n// error generated from somewhere\nvar err = new Error('some sample error');\n\n// stack is an array of CallSite objects\nvar stack = stackback(err);\n```\n\n## CallSite object\n\nFrom the [V8 StackTrace API](https://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/JavaScriptStackTraceApi)\n\nThe structured stack trace is an Array of CallSite objects, each of which represents a stack frame. A CallSite object defines the following methods\n\ngetThis: returns the value of this  \ngetTypeName: returns the type of this as a string. This is the name of the function stored in the constructor field of this, if available, otherwise the object's [[Class]] internal property.  \ngetFunction: returns the current function  \ngetFunctionName: returns the name of the current function, typically its name property. If a name property is not available an attempt will be made to try to infer a name from the function's context.  \ngetMethodName: returns the name of the property of this or one of its prototypes that holds the current function  \ngetFileName: if this function was defined in a script returns the name of the script  \ngetLineNumber: if this function was defined in a script returns the current line number  \ngetColumnNumber: if this function was defined in a script returns the current column number  \ngetEvalOrigin: if this function was created using a call to eval returns a CallSite object representing the location where eval was called  \nisToplevel: is this a toplevel invocation, that is, is this the global object?  \nisEval: does this call take place in code defined by a call to eval?  \nisNative: is this call in native V8 code?  \nisConstructor: is this a constructor call?  \n\n## install\n\n```shell\nnpm install stackback\n```\n",
