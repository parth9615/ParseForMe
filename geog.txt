We will study weather maps associated with different types of weather events.  In addition, we will examine their climatology, specifically where they typically occur (i.e. geographical distribution) and when they typically occur (i.e. time of day and season). Finally, we will discuss the impacts and dangers of extreme events and how to interpret forecasts of their occurrence.Over the course of the semester, we will explore wide range of web-based weather resources that provide a synopsis of the current state of the atmosphere. We will examine weather forecasts and learn how to make the best use of them.  Finally we will use various web-based climate resources that, among other things, reveal how recent weather trends compare with the past.  The first three to ten minutes of the lecture will typically be devoted to the current weather situation and forecasts over the next several days.Weather QuizzesA weather quiz will be posted on Sakai on most Wednesdays during the semester (beginning on 9/3).  It will be due the following Sunday evening at 1159pm. The quiz will consist of 30 questions that address recent lecture topics and recent weather described in class. You may work together to answer the quiz questions using any resources at your disposal (e.g. lecture notes, web resources etc.).  Weather ProjectYou will follow the daily weather across the southeastern U.S for an 8 week period (9/22-11/17) using a variety of web-based weather resources.  Specifically, you will document and describe occurrences of unusual weather (e.g. coldest temperature, heaviest rainfall, strongest wind etc.) with the goal of finding the most extreme conditions during the study period.  You will earn extra You will earn credit points if you identify a greater extreme than anyone in the class in a given weather category.  Details on this project will be provided in a few weeks.Grading 			Tests 				50% (Highest two of three on the tests, each counting 25%)Test 1 (9/19)                  		Test 2 (10/13)                          	Test 3 (11/17)Final Exam (12/12 @8am) 	20 % Weather quizzes		15 % Weather project 		15 %Total                                     	100 %Tests and the Final Exam Each test will consist of 40 multiple-choice questions that are drawn from the lecture material, weather quizzes, and in class weather discussions.  These questions will be answered on a scantron sheet, which can be obtained from the bookstore.  The final exam will include a take home section in which you will use web-based resources to interpret weather maps, forecasts, and climatologies. LecturesPower Point outlines of each lecture will be provided on the Sakai course website.  These outlines will include all graphics/maps presented in the lecture.  You are expected to attend class each day and take notes.  The Power Point outlines are not a substitute for the notes; they provide an organizing frame for the lecture details, which you will distill in your own words. You are expected to turn off all electronic devices during the lecture, except for those that are being used for classroom activities.  Laptop use will periodically be monitored to ensure that they are being used properly.
